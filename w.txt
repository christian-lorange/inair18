In particular, we will explore the balance between ventilation and air cleaning in different environments and building contexts. The indoor air community has long explored the value of ventilation and the importance of matching ventilation amounts and needs. Most jurisdictions rely on ventilation standards for new residential buildings and some ventilation standards allow a credit for air cleaning. However, the modern residential context for ventilation is complicated because of diversity of the global housing stock and the fact that many urban areas have high levels of ambient pollution. The questions that we will address in this symposium include: 1) Whether all the normal IAQ challenges can be addressed with air cleaning? 2) Should the balance between ventilation and air cleaning change in environments with higher levels of ambient pollution? 3) How should ventilation and air cleaning change for high performance homes? 4) What are appropriate ventilation and air cleaning change for multifamily residential buildings?   </p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 3: Explorations using distributed sensor networks to improve our understanding of the indoor environment and support practices that enhance health </h2><p class="description">We will explore how using distributed sensor networks to measure Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) factors like carbon dioxide (CO2), Temperature (T), and Relative Humidity (RH) might enable building owners to extend their practices and policies beyond comfort and safety goals toward enhancing the health and cognitive performance of occupants in office buildings. The symposium will present four novel findings from recent research conducted by the United States (US) General Services <br> Administration (GSA) and Google, Inc. We will discuss connections between IEQ and buildings, the value and limitations of sensing, and next steps for translating these findings into practice.  </p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 4: What are the impacts of humans and their activities on indoor chemistry?  </h2><p class="description">Chemistry initiated by the presence of humans and their activities can play an important, but poorly understood, role in indoor air quality. Occupant driven processes such as emission of reactive chemicals either from humans or from human activity lead to a variety of indoor chemical phenomena including gas/particle phase partitioning, new particle formation and growth, oxidative chemistry, photochemistry, and interactions with outdoor pollutants. Detailed measurements with a new generation of analytical instrumentation provide a wealth of new data to investigate these chemical processes, and better understand the role of human impact to indoor chemistry required to constrain the impact of these processes. This session will increase our understanding of the effects of human occupancy and human activities on gas and particle phase chemistry in the indoor environment. The state of the science of analytical measurement techniques and indoor chemical processes, as well as remaining gaps in our knowledge, will be reported in the Proceedings.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 5: Smart ventilation: Theory, applications, and case studies </h2><p class="description">The aim of this session, led in part by members of ISIAQ STC 21 on Ventilation, is to provide a coherent collection of paper presentations involving the theory, applications, and case studies of “smart ventilation” strategies and technologies. Ventilation has been identified as a key driver of indoor air quality, health, and productivity through decades of previous research, but only recently have we begun to explore novel concepts in how we provide ventilation in buildings in a more intelligent manner that minimizes energy use and the transport of outdoor pollutants, while meeting or exceeding ventilation rate requirements. The session will consolidate work in these areas into a format that summarizes the state-of-the-art of the field for conference attendees, while also establishing a vision for how research and practice can integrate in the future for implementing smarter ventilation strategies and systems in residential and commercial buildings.  </p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 6: Indoor pollutants from emerging smoking and vaping devices: Ecigarettes, “reduced-risk” tobacco products and waterpipes </h2><p class="description">This session will address the state of the science on fast evolving topics related with widespread consumption of emerging tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, vaporizing devices, heatnot-burn products, and waterpipes. The focus will be on describing the chemical composition of emissions, secondhand exposures and health impact on exposed populations. We will expand the scope to reduced-risk tobacco products (as defined by the US FDA) and to other smoking devices that are growing in popularity among youths, such as waterpipes and marijuana vaporizers.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 7: MOCCIE: first results from a new modelling consortium for indoor air chemistry </h2><p class="description">The aim of this session is to report the latest findings from the MOCCIE (MOdelling Consortium for Chemistry of Indoor Environments) consortium, part of an Alfred P. Sloan funded program to study Chemistry of Indoor Environments (CIE). A series of overview papers will describe highlights from the first year of research and detail future plans. This session will be of wide interest, given the MOCCIE consortium is combining state-of-the-art models describing molecular level dynamics, diffusion of indoor air pollutants through skin and clothing, detailed gas- and particle-phase chemistry and CFD (computational fluid dynamics) to develop the next generation of indoor air chemistry models.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 8: Improving IEQ in schools: the positive health impacts on school community </h2><p class="description">Over the last two years, scientists have been working in a US western state school district, hosting 32,000 students in over 50 schools. The District is implementing an unprecedented $500+ million bond program focused on conserving energy and other natural resources, and protecting student and staff health. The program provides a rare and significant opportunity for scientific evaluation of the potential co-benefits that can be realized in the school population, and the positive impacts within the community. The aims of this session are to discuss the framework for assessing the program’s effects on students’ health and the school community and to provide a venue for presenting findings from other school retrofit projects submitted to the conference. A discussion period will follow presentations.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 9: Smart Technologies for Enhancing IEQ </h2><p class="description">The objective of the symposium is to present recent developments and applications in the use of smart technologies for enhancing indoor environmental quality. In particular, focus is given to the development and deployment of integrated sensors and sensing technologies, data analytics, communication, and user interaction. Smart technologies have begun to pervade the built environment, making rapid advances in the sensing, analysis and use of data on a massive scale. For the indoor environment, what do these advancements herald? Would a more comprehensive and holistic monitoring of the indoor environmental parameters, in space and time, be easily achievable? If so, how would data analytics transform the accuracy of and the pace with which such information is obtained, communicated and acted upon? What would be the place of humans in this evolution, and how is human-centricity maintained or even enhanced?</p></div>

More and more buildings in China start to use mechanical ventilation to control indoor air quality. Mechanical ventilation would use considerable amount of energy. On the other hand, natural ventilation has been a very popular, traditional method in China, especially in southern China. Natural ventilation does not use energy but cannot control the penetration of outdoor pollutants to indoors. The aim of this session is to show the current status of ventilation and IAQ, to identify contaminant sources and their strengths, to develop models that can be used for studying and designing ventilation and IAQ, and to find solutions for ventilation and IAQ in Chinese homes. We will not only debate the pros and cons of natural ventilation based on measured indoor air quality and ventilation data but will stimulate discussion among audience to learn their experience and lessons on ventilation and IAQ in other countries. Part 1 of 2.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 11: Frontiers in indoor air chemistry  </h2><p class="description">The aim of this session is to report research at the frontiers of indoor air chemistry, whether that be carried out in the field, through laboratory experiments or via model simulations. We envisage that the reported research will be novel, highly interdisciplinary in nature and subsequently, of wide interest to ALL who study indoor air chemistry. Through a combination of invited presentations and assembled papers from the wider submission of abstracts, we put together a program that highlights the most cutting edge research efforts in this area.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 12: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of indoor pollutant transport and human exposure </h2><p class="description">In this session, we will discuss/summarize the state-of-the-art CFD modeling techniques and main research findings for studying heterogeneous pollutant distribution in building environments. The session aims to identify strengths and weaknesses of CFD modeling studies in pollutant dynamics and human exposure at four different scales: 1) near-body scale; 2) room scale; 3) whole building scale; an 4) urban scale. At these four scales, we expect to determine practical issues in applying CFD modeling to pollutant dynamics and discuss future research directions for indoor CFD modeling community.</p></div>

<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 14: Improving practical microbial assessments for studying occupant health and investigating building health  </h2><p class="description">Currently, there are no practical, validated strategies for environmental microbial identification in buildings that meet two kinds of research needs: those of researchers who are studying health effects of microbial exposures in buildings, and those of investigators of moisture and microbial growth in buildings, who may need to assess the need for remediation or the adequacy of remediation already performed. Current microbial identification methods used in damp buildings are thus not yet adequate for assessing either human health or building health. In this session, our goal will be to stimulate a focused discussion on how to make microbial identification methods more informative for both occupant health studies and microbial investigations. The focus will be on making sequencebased/molecular methods (e.g., next- generation sequencing, polymerase chain reaction/qPCR) of microbial identification more comprehensive and fully quantitative. Our approach will be to bring together speakers to discuss (1) current limitations in using microbiologic measurements to study human health effects in buildings or to investigate water-damaged buildings; (2) strategies they have used to improve the application of these microbiological measurements; and (3) ideas for improving future microbial identification methods to be more comprehensive and quantitative. Following the presentations, we will engage the speakers and the audience together to discuss current limitations and generate promising approaches for improved, practical microbiological assessment in buildings.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 15: Numerical modeling of cross-ventilation flows: overview of past studies and discussion on future directions </h2><p class="description">Cross ventilation can be used to provide a healthy and comfortable indoor environment in buildings. Moreover, cross ventilation is often applied as passive cooling technique to reduce mechanical cooling demands (i.e., ventilative cooling, night cooling). Cross-ventilation flows can be predicted using numerical models, of which a variety exists and has been used to obtain information on the flow fields around and in cross-ventilated buildings. The aim of the session is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of numerical modeling techniques employed in the past for the assessment of cross-ventilation flows (e.g. RANS, LES, Lattice Boltzmann, airflow networks); (2) to have an interactive discussion with the audience on which numerical techniques are most suitable for different purposes, with a special focus on the required level of detail, the accuracy of the numerical technique and the computational demand related to the numerical techniques available.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 16: TILT: Identifying Initiators and Triggers of Chemical Intolerance </h2><p class="description">Toxicant Induced Loss of Tolerance (TILT) is a disease mechanism associated with chemical intolerance. Exposures commonly associated with TILT include construction, chemical spills, pesticide applications, household products, and military exposures. Symptoms are persistent and disabling for a susceptible subset of the population. Researchers and doctors have documented this phenomenon in more than a dozen countries where people speak different languages and have different media. Why doesn’t everyone who is exposed get sick, and why don’t those who get sick get better once the exposure stops? Most doctors didn’t learn about TILT during medical school. TILT is a two-stage disease process initiated by a single major exposure, or a series of low-level chemical exposures (Stage I, Initiation). Affected individuals experience diverse, long-lasting symptoms that are subsequently triggered by everyday chemicals, foods, and drugs that did not previously bother them (Stage II, Triggering). Participants will have an opportunity to complete a three-item screening questionnaire for CI called the Brief Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (BREESI), as well as a brief home environmental inventory. A live, interactive data feedback system will be used to enable presenters to immediately display and discuss results.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 17: Water on surfaces and dust: Implications for indoor chemistry and microbiology  </h2><p class="description">Dampness has an established negative impact on health, yet we do not fully understand how increased moisture influences changes in human exposure. This water plays an important role in both indoor chemistry and microbiology.  In many problems, the key parameter is available water. Available water is often defined at equilibrium conditions; however, conditions in buildings are often highly transient. Water availability is influenced by wetting/drying dynamics as well as changes in conditions that lead to condensation or adsorbed water amounts, and release of liquid water from enclosure or plumbing leaks, air conditioning condensate, and indoor water sources. When water is available it often is a key driver of microbiological growth. Adsorbed and liquid water also provide pathways for chemical reactions that are distinct from those that occur in the gas phase. Additionally, we often lack appropriate measurement approaches to characterize available water in indoor environments. Improved understanding of water availability in indoor environments is critical to both understanding chemical and microbial process as well as determining the influence of moisture in homes on human health. This session will explore the role of water in indoor chemical and microbiological processes. The talks and discussion will consider the role of water in different indoor microenvironments (dust, HVAC systems, surfaces) and address issues of measurement and characterization of available water for chemistry and microbiology.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 18: Indoor Air Quality in Energy Efficient New Homes: Findings from Field Studies in North America, China and Europe </h2><p class="description">The goal of this symposium is to share data and analyses relevant to the question of whether there should be particular concerns about indoor air quality in energy-efficient new homes. The symposium will include studies from 5 different countries (China, US, France, Austria, Sweden) and a presentation about VOCs in new homes that will reference studies from around the world.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 19: Applying Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) to Estimate Human Health Impacts in the Indoor Air Environment </h2><p class="description">QMRA has been applied to estimate human health risks in multiple contexts. In indoor air, it has been used to estimate inhalation risks from bacteria and viruses, with limited information on fungi. This symposium will present the principles of QMRA applied to estimating risk from inhaled particles from the indoor environment.  The framework will be shown, issues with estimating source strength of microorganisms to the indoor air environment and respirable fractions will be discussed, and issues with applying analytical methods (especially those relying upon molecular methods) will be presented. Limitations and data gaps will be formulated particularly with the improved ability to directly sequence air samples. We expect the outcome will be a summary of the state of the art of QMRA in indoor air.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 20: Emissions from humans: What do we know and what should we know?  </h2><p class="description">This session aims to summarize the current knowledge on human bioeffluents and discuss how to advance this knowledge through future research studies. The presentations will provide information on the pollutants emitted by humans, on factors that influence and/or modify these emissions, on differences between pollutants emitted from different body parts and on the effects of bioeffluents on humans, in particular on comfort (perception of air quality and odor), acute health symptoms and cognitive performance. Examples of how human bioeffluents can be quantified in field will be given. The discussion will be focused on the insufficiency of the present knowledge and future research. The aim will be to identify strategic directions for future experiments that will not only advance our knowledge on human bioeffluents beyond the present state of the art but will also allow to technically deal with these emissions.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 21: How (and why) does filter efficiency change over time? </h2><p class="description">Filtration efficiency is dynamic rather than static. The conventional model is that filters increase in efficiency as they load with particles. This is true for filters that rely on primarily mechanical means to remove particles. However, approximately half of the current global filtration market is composed of filters that use charged media and rely on electrostatic forces to remove particles. There is ample documentation that such filters can decline in efficiency as they age, but there is substantial variation in the amount of decline that occurs. Some filters in some building experience dramatic declines in performance and others experience negligible changes in efficiency. The aim of this session is to summarize the factors that influence changes in filtration performance during ageing and outline future research needs to better predict changes in size-resolved filtration efficiencies and pressure drops of filters over their service life. This information is essential to understanding the actual performance of particle filters used in buildings.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 22: The use of low-cost sensors for monitoring indoor air and exposure </h2><p class="description">The use of low-cost sensors for assessing indoor air quality and human exposure to pollutants is increasing as the sensors are becoming more reliable and less expensive. The low-cost sensors can be used to increase the temporal and spatial resolution of air quality measurements, but the low-cost sensors have performance limitations. The speakers for this session will assess both the advantages and the limitations of low-cost sensors with the goal of determining their usefulness for indoor air and exposure studies. In this session, we propose to characterize the utility of low-cost sensors for monitoring indoor air and exposure. Researchers who have deployed low-cost monitors for laboratory and field studies will discuss their findings.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Symposium 23: Clothing and other textiles as mediators of personal exposure to indoor pollutants </h2><p class="description">Clothing has recently been identified as an important mediator of exposure to indoor pollutants. Clothing can be protective, by acting as a physical barrier and also by sorbing or reacting with airborne chemicals. However, clothing and other textiles (e.g. bedding) can accumulate chemicals and particles and contribute to the overall body burden via dermal uptake, inhalation and ingestion. Mechanisms controlling this exposure have been hypothesized, but experimental evidence supporting specific mechanisms is limited. In this session, we will identify key open questions and short-term research goals to advance our knowledge of the impact of clothing and other textiles on exposure to pollutants of indoor origin.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 1: Aerosols: Life as Pig-Pen: Immersed in a Cloud of Particles and Microbes </h2><p class="description">Human-driven resuspension can be the most significant indoor emission source of coarse-mode (> 1 m) abiotic and biological particulate matter. The aim of this session is to bring together an interdisciplinary panel to summarize the current state of knowledge and identify future research directions pertaining to indoor particle resuspension and desquamation; the factors which govern particle adhesion to surfaces, detachment into the air, and transport within the perihuman environment; and the implications of the Pig-Pen effect for human inhalation exposures to the microbial, allergenic, and chemical content of indoor dust.  </p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 2: Measuring Ventilation in IAQ Studies of Schools: Challenges and Solutions? (STC 21) </h2><p class="description">Indoor air quality in schools is a topic of much interest given the linkages between indoor environments and student performance and health outcomes. Many studies have been conducted internationally to better understand these linkages and to better understand the important building, occupant and environmental factors. Characterizing ventilation performance and estimating outdoor air change rates has been a challenge in all of these studies due to the complexity of the building and HVAC system layouts, limitations in the time and money available for the studies, and a limited understanding of ventilation design and performance on the part of some investigators. The use of carbon dioxide to estimate air change rates presents an additional challenge due to the underlying assumptions that must be met for carbon dioxide-based approaches to be useful. This session is intended to explore these challenges in hopes of informing on the usefulness for ventilation characterization in future IAQ studies in schools. Among other topics, the need to design one’s measurements based on the building and HVAC system layout will be stressed, as well as the need to characterize measurement uncertainty, including the importance of repeating measurements and using multiple techniques when possible. IAQ studies in schools will be described to explore approaches that have been used, and attendees will be invited to describe their studies and the challenges they have faced in their work.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 3: Compliance in Ventilation Standards using Natural Ventilation </h2><p class="description">Currently, ASHRAE Standard 62.1 provides very little information on how to comply with the standard when using NV. The NV portion in the standard is conceived as an alternative to the mechanically driven ventilate rate procedure (VRP) and indoor air quality procedure (IAQP) and contains very limited language, in part due to the complexity of natural ventilation airflows, including their inherently transient nature. With the only real compliance path currently set to a specific percentage of opening size per floor area (which is the same as CIBSE’s AM10), designers and engineers who want to leverage NV strategies that rely on engineered systems (e.g., trickle ventilators, solar chimneys, etc.) have no real guideline nor a clear path for compliance under the current standard. In this session, we will consider ways to leverage existing literature, knowledge, and methodologies to demonstrate a path to satisfy the VRP or IAQP standard with NV, taking into account its unsteady nature. In this session, we aim to determine the meaning of “compliance” in terms of satisfying the ventilation requirements in ASHRAE Standard 62.1 using natural ventilation (NV). The discussion aims to work toward a framework for consolidating the inherently transient nature of airflow rates under natural ventilation conditions with the single ventilation requirement in the standard that is more consistent with steady-state mechanical ventilation system operation. It is expected that the discussion will produce a consensus on how to demonstrate that NV is sufficient for a building (i.e., compliant with the 62.1 standard).</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 4: Household energy transitions to address air pollution exposure, health, and climate burdens associated with solid fuel burning </h2><p class="description">Residential space heating and cooking are critical household energy service needs worldwide. Demand for these services is driven by local environmental (e.g. land-use), climate, and seasonal conditions. In areas where heating is required, homes reliant on solid fuels (i.e. biomass, coal, trash) for cooking often rely on solid fuels for heating as well. Homes relying on traditional cooking devices likely also use inefficient heating devices (e.g. fireplaces, outdated stoves and boilers, or open fires), which like the cooking devices, produce high emissions that adversely impact indoor and outdoor/ambient air quality, personal exposure, and health. This session will discuss and debate research, implementation needs, and advances related to use of solid fuel for meeting residential heating needs and its associated impacts on indoor and outdoor air quality, health, and climate. We will examine past and present policies, approaches, and technologies aimed at mitigating health and climate burden associated with pollutant emissions from solid fuel space heating. Our discussion will draw on existing and emerging insights from researchers and practitioners representing industrialized and developing regions of the world, including South America, Northern and Eastern Europe, and East Asia. We aim to identify knowledge gaps, research priorities to address these gaps, and opportunities for interdisciplinary and transnational learning and collaboration.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 5: Measurement and experimental challenges in sleep related IAQ studies </h2><p class="description">In this workshop, we will integrate panel presentations and open group discussion to frame the basic methodological conditions for conducting experimental research in the emerging field of sleep IAQ.  In doing so, we will provide guidance for replicating published and ongoing IAQ studies centered on the sleep microenvironment, ensuring results can be generalized and confirmed. There is a general lack of common experimental chamber methods and field measurement protocols in this emerging area of research. Therefore, it is very important to bring in input from different interdisciplinary research groups around the world that work in this field, alongside input from the general IAQ audience and IAQ practitioners and try to reach a consensus.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 6: Ventilation and Transmission of Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses </h2><p class="description">The role of ventilation in transmission of influenza is still unclear due to unknown environ-mental conditions at the time of actual flu virus transmission and an undefined role of the air-borne mode of transmission. This is true of influenza virus and even more so for other respiratory viruses. A major question is to identify workable epidemiologic study designs – can experimental infections and quarantine studies work? What are the obstacles to studies in nursing homes, college dorms, private homes? How can both the environment and outcomes be measured effectively? How can one control for confounding by other exposure sources, host immunity? This workshop is to consolidate the stateof-the-art of research methods and study designs to define the role ventilation plays in influenza transmission and transmission of other acute respiratory infections. Furthermore, the workshop is to explore future research avenues in ad-dressing the knowledge gaps in our current understanding of the ventilation in flu transmission.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 7: Translating sleep IEQ research into new residential ventilation standards </h2><p class="description">We spend one-third of our lives sleeping. Poor IAQ and unsatisfactory thermal comfort in the bedroom and sleep microenvironment may play an important role in human health, sleep quality, and next-day performance. This workshop focuses on translating the latest sleep IAQ research into provisions for residential ventilation, bedroom-specific air purification, and thermal comfort standards. The themes include: particle exposure and air purification systems for bedrooms; local thermal comfort and bedding; noise; local sources and exhaled CO2; bedroom ventilation strategies.</p></div>
<div class="mySlides"><h2 class="symp">Workshop 8: Healthy building with the WELL building standard </h2><p class="description">The objective of this interactive workshop is to inform conference participants about the ins and outs of the WELL building standard, see www.wellcertified.com (especially the IAQ and thermal comfort aspects). One of the issues that will be addressed is the science behind the WELL criteria. During the interactive session at the end we - all participants together - will try to answer questions like ‘are buildings with a WELL platinum score really healthier than average?’ and ‘are the right IAQ aspects addressed in WELL?’</p></div>
